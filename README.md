<b>COLDFUSION FMP TUTORIAL</b>
<p>
FMP (Financial Modeling Prep) provides access to over 20,000 publicly traded companies.<br>
The objective of this project is to demonstrate how to use the FMP data in a Coldfusion environment to retrieve stock prices, earnings reports, financial statements, and much more.
<p>
I explain how to do it, and offer some CF code examples that can easily be implemented by anyone that is familiar with Coldfusion.
