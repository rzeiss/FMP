<b>COLDFUSION FMP TUTORIAL</b>
<p>
If you are intested in the stock market, and want to do some FINANCIAL MODELING, then <a href="https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs" target=:_blank">
  FMP</a> will provide all the data you will ever need. It is a great resource that can be used with many web programming languages.  This is about how to use FMP with Coldfusion.
<p>
FMP (Financial Modeling Prep) provides access to over 20,000 publicly traded companies.<br>
The objective of this project is to demonstrate how to use the FMP data in a Coldfusion environment to retrieve stock prices, earnings reports, financial statements, and much more.
<p>
I'll explain how to do it, and offer some CF code examples that can easily be implemented by anyone that is familiar with Coldfusion.  Of course to run the CF code will require a ColdFusion Server.
<p>
  The first example is named.. <b>get_price.cfm</b>.  It will retrieve a SHORT QUOTE from FMP.  It returns "theprice" given a stock symbol (SYM).  It is designed to be an "include" in a higher level program.  I will also discuss the higher level program.
<p>

<p>
There are hundreds of functions available to retrieve financial data on American and foreign companies.  Once you capture the data it can be used for examining what has happened in the past, or even what may happen in the future, if your model is capable of such a prediction.
